# DungeonRise-Scripts
Collection of scripts used in Unity development for new game
I am developing a very simple vertical dungeon crawler in Unity and want experience with VCS and possible collaboration with those willing to input.
I am using this repository to store all of my main scripts for all game mechanics, i continually mess up and alter scripts beyond repair so this way i can gain experience in version control systems and maintain backups of my working code to roll back to if necessary.
